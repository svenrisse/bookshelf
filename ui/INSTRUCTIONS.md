# Instructions to work on UI

## some preliminary considerations:

- do you want to use a component library? 
    [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is considered on of the best on the market right now
    [daisyui](https://daisyui.com/) is a well established alternative

- let's assume the stakeholders dont have any requirements for testing the ui.
    considering that, decide what should be tested regardless and what tools might be useful for that  
    (vitest, playwright, cypress, jest, react-testing-library,...)
